# Manual

The keyboard driver is based on **InScript** (short for Indic Script) as standardized by the [Government of India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_India "Government of India").

### Quickstart

The Inscript keyboard layout was designed to make it easy to type in all Indian scripts. It uses the same layout for all languages, and has been standardised by the Government of India. There are separate keys for consonants and vowels. Most Bengali characters have both consonant and vowel parts, and each part should be typed separately. The consonant part is always typed before the vowel, no matter where the vowel part is written..

For example, typing  `F` will produce the vowel  ই. If this vowel is combined with a consonant, though, such as  কি, the vowel part  ি  is typed with  `f`  after the consonant has been typed. If you press Backspace once, only the vowel part will be erased, and you can type a different vowel.

### Example

|In Bangla |English Phonic|Type the following keys|
|--|--|--|
|বাংলা লিপি|Bangla Lipi|`b` `e` `x` `n` `e` `space` `n` `f` `h` `f`|

### Keyboard Details

The Keyboard shows the 35 normal consonants  ক খ গ ঘ ঙ চ ছ জ ঝ ঞ ট ঠ ড ঢ ণ ত থ দ ধ ন প ফ ব ভ ম য় র ল শ ষ স হ য ড় ঢ়, the vowels  অ আ ই ঈ উ ঊ ঋ এ ঐ ও ঔ ্ া ি ী ু ূ ৃ ে ৈ ো ৌ, and the  ্ ত্ ং ঃ ঁ  marks. There are also numbers and punctuation marks.

Bengali vowels and consonants are usually combined, so when you type a consonant and a vowel part, they will be joined into one character. If you use the arrow keys to move through the text, you only need to press an arrow key once to move past each character. If you press `Delete` before (on the left of) a combined consonant and vowel, it will be erased completely, but if you press `Backspace` after a character, only the vowel part will be erased (even if the vowel part appears before the consonant).

#### Vowels and Consonants

When you type consonants and vowel parts, you should always type the consonant part first, even when the vowel part appears on the left of the consonant. If you type any of the independent vowels, they will not be combined with consonants.

All the consonants naturally include the vowel sound  অ, so if you want to produce a consonant with no vowel, you need to add the  ্  mark. You can do this by typing  `d`  right after typing a consonant. After you have typed the  ্  mark, you cannot type a vowel to combine with that consonant.

Bengali includes many combined consonants, and these are not on the keyboard. To type a combined consonant, type the first consonant, then the  ্  mark, then the second consonant. The computer will then combine the two consonants into a single combined character. For example, typing  `k` `d` `k`  produces the combined consonant  ক্ক.

### Keyboard Reference Chart

The following chart lists all the normal characters available with this keyboard. Below each character are the keys used to type it.  
Because Bengali includes hundreds of combined consonants, these are not shown on this chart. To type combined consonants, type a  ্  mark (`d`) between the two consonants.

### Troubleshooting

#### Fonts

If you see squares when you type, or the Bengali characters do not appear correctly, please install a proper Unicode/Bangla font in your system.

#### Problem Solving

If a vowel does not combine with a consonant, make sure you have typed the consonant first. Also check that you have not typed another vowel already, or a standalone vowel, or the  ্  mark.

### System Requirements

It is recommended that you use an English QWERTY hardware keyboard with this keyboard.
